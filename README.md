My name is Murilo AmÃªndola, I am a brazilian guy that loves everything related to technology! I've been working on software development since 2006. Now a days I am a working on [Juntos Somos Mais](https://www.juntossomosmais.com.br/) as a Engineering Coordinator.

At this long carreer I've seen a lot of things and I'd the pleasure to work with fantastic people that teached me a lot.

Serverless architecture is one of my favorite tool in my tools box ðŸ˜„. I really like this theme and I've experience using it in production environment with really good results (thinking in cost, escalability and resilience).
